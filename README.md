> Animating logo for January

Usage:
* `npm i velocity-animate`
* Place `AnimatingLogo.vue` and `JanuaryLogo.svg` in the same directory (or change `import logoSvg from '...'` to the SVG location)
* Leave the `text` prop blank to use the default logo animation. Fill in `text` to create a typing animation.
